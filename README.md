# Insider Threat Dashboard â€” Updated UI (app_new.py)

This package contains an updated, eye-catching Streamlit UI (app_new.py) that highlights threat users separately and provides a clean dashboard for demos.

Files:
- app_new.py : Polished Streamlit dashboard (open with `streamlit run app_new.py`)
- requirements.txt : Python dependencies
- README.md : This file

Usage:
1. Place your dataset in one of the expected locations, or upload it using the sidebar file uploader in the app.
   Expected paths (app will try these automatically):

   - insider_illegal_demo/insider_illegal_demo.csv
   - insider_dataset.csv

   pip install -r requirements.txt
   streamlit run app_new.py
   ```
